## Notes
I am a designer and this was my first mobile application. Had to go through a couple of introductry iOS explaination videos from Udemy to understand different parts of Xcode and Swift.
UI Animations were a tough nut to crack. Had to go through the official Swift documentation and couple of blog posts in order to undertand it.
